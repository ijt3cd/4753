										<h2>Welcome to Datanamics.</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Back in high school, we watched the movie <em>Moneyball</em>, marveling at the ability of
										statistics to predict sports performance. Today, it seems nearly all professional teams in a variety of sports take statistical measures when building their programs. Even fans pull out stats when talking about games, from shooting percentages to number of assists.
									</p>
									<p>
										We love this trend and the beautiful statistical diagrams that now pop up on all of the different sports talk shows, but we began to realize there was a distinct lack of such growth in statistical analysis in high school sports. No matter the sport, there are always situations where the flashy player isn't the best option or a star player isn't being used to his or her full potential&mdash;or even being noticed at all. That's why we've created Datanamics to supply high school coaches with the tools needed to take their game to the next level.
									</p>
									<p>
										Through our subscription-based plan, customers will receive access to our special statistical recording software, digital data sheets for stat input, and proprietary algorithms that analyze given data for automatic feedback. As an additional service, we can also include personalized analysis from one of our company's sports analytic experts. 
									</p>
									<p>
										For anyone not coaching at the professional or top college levels, there is a lack of affordable access to statistical analysis. We aim to change that to allow for better player development and competition. We want your success to the best that it can be; try us out and discover how you can take your team further than ever before.
									</p>
									<p>
										Thank you,
										<br/>
										Harriet Cao, Isaac Tessler, and Grant Zou
